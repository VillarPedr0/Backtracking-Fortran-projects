# Backtracking Fortran projects
This collection of projects delves into the fascinating realm of algorithmic problem-solving using the backtracking technique. Backtracking is a powerful strategy that involves exploring and navigating through a search space to find solutions efficiently.
 
# What is Backtracking?
Backtracking is a systematic approach used to solve complex problems by trying out various possibilities, undoing incorrect choices, and retracing steps when necessary. It's particularly useful for problems with multiple paths to explore, where brute-force methods might be impractical due to the exponential growth of potential solutions. In this repository, we leverage the capabilities of the Fortran programming language to implement and experiment with various backtracking algorithms.

# Repository Structure
`src/`: This directory contains the Fortran source code for the various backtracking projects organized by folders.
